      <description>Hi Everyone, 

Kodingen.com is now open for beta testers after long days and nights of development. We would like to share with you what we have done so far and get your feedback. 

In this beta release, you can create files, folders, connect to your ftp drives, use mysql databases and code. 

Our aim in developing Kodingen is to remove all barriers that stand between you and those cool web applications you want to develop. As you know, even to get your simple &#8220;Hello World&#8221; running, you need to download and install a lot of programs, deal with PHP, Apache installations, buy a code editor, set up an FTP server and go through lots of other mind-numbing tasks. 

No more. We are very excited to give you Kodingen, a tool where you can connect your FTP&#8217;s, create databases, have your SVN and bugt</description>
