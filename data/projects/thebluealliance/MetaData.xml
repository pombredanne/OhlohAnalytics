      <description>The Blue Alliance is a FIRST Robotics Match Video repository website. Teams can visit the site and scout for future events, as well as watch their performance at previous events. 

Visit http://firstwiki.net/index.php/TheBlueAllianceOpenSource for more information about this project. 

The Blue Alliance has released some of the code that drives The Blue Alliance site as an open source project. It is our hope that community members can use our code to learn from and set up their own versions of the site for fun. Perhaps some people will even come up with betters ways to do some of the things that The Blue Alliance does and will contribute improvements back to the code base. 

Basically, there are a few goals for this initiative: 

Let anyone who wants to see the entire guts of a web site. Most of us behind TBA developed our interest in web development in high school, and we hope other people can be inspired to poke and tinker. Ensure that if everyone responsible for The Blue Alliance dropped off the face of the Earth at once, someone else would be able to set it back up. Let other people contibute code, since we don't have infinite resources to make everything as awesome as it could be.</description>
