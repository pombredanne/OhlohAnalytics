      <description>There are plenty of Lisp Markup Languages out there - every Lisp programmer seems to write at least one during his career - and CL-WHO (where WHO means &quot;with-html-output&quot; for want of a better acronym) is probably just as good or bad as the next one. They are all more or less similar in that they provide convenient means to convert S-expressions intermingled with code into (X)HTML, XML, or whatever but differ with respect to syntax, implementation, and API. So, if you haven't made a choice yet, check out the alternatives as well before you begin to use CL-WHO just because it was the first one you came across.</description>
