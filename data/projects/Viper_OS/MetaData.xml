      <description>Viper OS is a Linux operating system developed by Viper Amped. This is a revamped version of Ubuntu which includes a dark appearance. All the system's artwork is custom-made to blend together. Offering full multilingual support it comes with Gnome installed as the default window manager and Firefox to make your browsing experience the best it can be. The package management and update system are the same as Ubuntu's but expect to see some unique programs included in the future. Viper OS makes a great live-cd/dvd and installs very smoothly. Some of the minimum system requirements are at least 4GB of hard drive space (5 or more recommended) and 390MB or more of system memory (RAM).</description>
