      <description>TEAM's TimeTracker is an attempt to provide people who spend their work time in front of a PC with a simple and unintrusive way to keep track of their time usage. There are some other similar applications out there, but TEAM's TimeTracker claims to be the simpler and less intrusive. Try it yourself and send any comments to: rodolfograve@yahoo.es 

Motivation: - In my company we are required to work 40 hours a week: they don't care how you spare this time amongst working days, they just make us check our finger prints into a device everytime we go in or out of the office. However, they don't provide us with an easy way to check how much time have we already work each week. I searched the web for some FREE tools providing this simple functionality and found... NONE! There were a lot of time tracking tools but not of them was simple and unintrusive so I came up with this. While building it some additional features were added in but the main usage is to keep real track of your personal time, without any additional concerns. 

Usage: - You just &quot;install and go&quot; for the basic usage. If you want more advanced functions then you may start looking for some help or whatever, but you'll need absolutely NO HELP to start up.
