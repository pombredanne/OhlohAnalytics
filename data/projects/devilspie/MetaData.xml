      <description>A window-matching utility, inspired by Sawfish's &quot;Matched Windows&quot; option and the lack of the functionality in Metacity. Metacity lacking window matching is not a bad thing &#8212; Metacity is a lean window manager, and window matching does not have to be a window manager task.

Devil's Pie can be configured to detect windows as they are created, and match the window to a set of rules. If the window matches the rules, it can perform a series of actions on that window. For example, I can make all windows created by X-Chat appear on all workspaces, and the main Gkrellm1 window does not appear in the pager or task list.</description>
