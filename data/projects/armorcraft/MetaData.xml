      <description>This site hosts my World of Warcraft addons projects the first one of which was ArmorCraft. 

ArmorCraft is a WoW add-on for scanning an armor crafting window and displaying the highest armor that can be crafted for a given level. This makes it much easier to see if you can craft a better piece of armor for yourself or another player. You can also compare a specific armor or weapon with the one in use by a target player and your alternates. Blacksmiths and Engineers will also show the best melee weapon or gun that can be crafted. 

ArmorCraftCache is a companion addon for ArmorCraft that save the character information needed from your alts. You need to log once on each of your characters to see them appear in the ArmorCraft Dropdown list. ArmorCraftCache will be selected before RPGO Character Profiler is both are present. 

MoreDressUpButtons is WoW add-on that add Clear, Self and Target buttons to the DressUp window. 

TourGuide_Jame_Alliance_Northrend is my personal version of Jame's Leveling guide to be used with Tekkub's Tourguide. 

AllPlayed is another one of my projects that is hosted on the WoWAce site. It's an addon that track time played, rested XP, total XP, level, location and money for all characters for an WoW account. 

DominosFu is an addaptation of BongosFu that I've done for Tuller's Dominos. Also hosted in the WoWAce repository. 

ShuckIt is a data broker that will display and allow you to easily open items, like clams, in your inventory that contains other items. Each time to click on ShuckIt, it will open the next openable item in your bags no matter what it is or where it is. Another one hosted in the WoWAce repository.
