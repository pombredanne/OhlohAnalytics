      <description>The object of this project is to demonstrate that formalized mathematical theories can, like modern software, be built out of components. By components we mean modules that comprise both the static (objects and facts) and dynamic (proof and computation methods) contents of theories. We propose to develop a general platform for mathematical components, based on the Coq &#8220;Ssreflect&#8221; extension that was used to carry out the formalization of the Four Colour Theorem. We would validate the platform on two significant developments: a theory of efficient arithmetic, and the proof of the Odd Order theorem. The former could be used in the resolution of several outstanding computer proof challenges, among them the Kepler Conjecture, and the latter could become the first step in a new major challenge:</description>
